            Heart beats fast<br />
            Colors and promises<br />
            How to be brave?<br />
            How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?<br />
            But watching you stand alone<br />
            All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow<br />
            One step closer<br />
            I have died every day waiting for you<br />
            Darling, don't be afraid<br />
            I have loved you<br />
            For a thousand years<br />
            I'll love you for a thousand more<br />
            Time stands still<br />
            Beauty in all she is<br />
            I will be brave<br />
            I will not let anything take away<br />
            What's standing in front of me<br />
            Every breath<br />
            Every hour has come to this<br />
            One step closer<br />
            I have died every day waiting for you<br />
            Darling, don't be afraid<br />
            I have loved you<br />
            For a thousand years<br />
            I'll love you for a thousand more<br />
            And all along I believed I would find you<br />
            Time has brought your heart to me<br />
            I have loved you for a thousand years<br />
            I'll love you for a thousand more<br />
            One step closer<br />
            One step closer<br />
            I have died every day waiting for you<br />
            Darling don't be afraid<br />
            I have loved you<br />
            For a thousand years<br />
            I'll love you for a thousand more<br />
            And all along I believed I would find you<br />
            Time has brought your heart to me<br />
            I have loved you for a thousand years<br />

              What would I do without your smart mouth?<br />
              Drawing me in, and you kicking me out<br />
              You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down<br />
              What's going on in that beautiful mind<br />
              I'm on your magical mystery ride<br />
              And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright<br />
              My head's under water<br />
              But I'm breathing fine<br />
              You're crazy and I'm out of my mind<br />
              Cause all of me<br />
              Loves all of you<br />
              Love your curves and all your edges<br />
              All your perfect imperfections<br />
              Give your all to me<br />
              I'll give my all to you<br />
              You're my end and my beginning<br />
              Even when I lose I'm winning<br />
              Cause I give you all of me<br />
              And you give me all of you, oh oh<br />
              How many times do I have to tell you<br />
              Even when you're crying you're beautiful too<br />
              The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood<br />
              You're my downfall, you're my muse<br />
              My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues<br />
              I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you<br />
              My head's under water<br />
              But I'm breathing fine<br />
              You're crazy and I'm out of my mind<br />
              Cause all of me<br />
              Loves all of you<br />
              Love your curves and all your edges<br />
              All your perfect imperfections<br />
              Give your all to me<br />
              I'll give my all to you<br />
              You're my end and my beginning<br />
              Even when I lose I'm winning<br />
              Cause I give you all of me<br />
              And you give me all of you, oh oh<br />
              Give me all of you<br />
              Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts<br />
              Risking it all, though it's hard<br />
              Cause all of me<br />
              Loves all of you<br />
              Love your curves and all your edges<br />

            I shouldn't have walked away<br />
            I would've stayed if you say<br />
            We could've made<br />
            Everything ok<br />
            But we just<br />
            Threw the blame back and forth<br /> 
            We treated love like a sport <br />
            The final blow hit so low<br />
            I'm still on the ground<br />

            I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall<br />
            Shattered in pieces curled on the floor<br />
            Supernatural love conquers all<br />
            'Member we used to touch the sky<br />
            And<br />

            Lightning don't strike<br />
            The same place twice<br />
            When you and I<br />
            Said goodbye<br />
            I felt the angels cry<br />

            True love's a gift<br />
            But we let it drift<br />
            In a storm<br />
            Every night<br />
            I feel the angels cry<br />

            C'mon babe can't our love be revived<br />
            Bring it back and we gon' make it right<br />
            I'm on the edge just tryin' to survive<br />
            As the angels cry<br />

            [Ne-Yo]:<br />
            I thought we'd be forever and always <br />
            You were serenity <br />
            You took away the bad days<br />

            Didn't always treat you right but it was okay <br />
            I do somethin' stupid and you still stay with me<br />

            But you can only go for so long <br />
            Doing the one you claim to love wrong<br />

            Before too much is enough... <br />
            You look up<br />
            Find your love gone...<br /> 
            And... <br />

            We were so good together <br />
            How come we could not weather<br />
            This storm and just do better<br />
            Why did we say goodbye<br />

            Cause lightning don't strike<br />
            The same place twice<br />
            When you and I<br />
            Said goodbye<br />
            I felt the angels cry<br />
            True love's a gift<br />
            But we let it drift<br />
            In a storm<br />
            Every night<br />
            I feel the angels cry<br />

            Come on baby can our love be revived<br />
            Bring it back and we're gon' make it right<br />
            I'm on the edge just trying to survive<br />
            As the angels cry<br />

            Baby I'm missin' you<br />
            Don't allow love to lose<br />
            We gotta ride it through<br />
            I'm reaching for you <br />

            Baby I'm missin' you<br />
            Don't allow love to lose<br />
            We gotta ride it through<br />
            I'm reaching for you<br />

            Lightning don't strike<br />
            The same place twice<br />
            When you and I<br />
            Said goodbye<br />
            Felt the angels cry<br />

            True love's a gift<br />
            But we let it slip<br />
            In a storm<br />
            Every night<br />
            I feel the angels cry<br /></p></center><br />

            <p> <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            I'm so glad you made time to see me<br />
            How's life, tell me how's your family?<br />
            I haven't seen them in a while<br />
            You've been good, busier then ever<br />
            We small talk, work and the weather<br />
            Your guard is up and I know why<br />
            Because the last time you saw me<br />
            Is still burned in the back of your mind<br />
            You gave me roses and I left them there to die<br />
            So this is me swallowing my pride<br />
            Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night<br />
            And I go back to December all the time<br />
            It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<br />
            Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br />
            I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right<br />
            I go back to December all the time<br />
            These days I haven't been sleeping<br />
            Staying up playing back myself leaving<br />
            When your birthday passed and I didn't call<br />
            And I think about summer, all the beautiful times<br />
            I watched you laughing from the passenger side<br />
            And realized I'd loved you in the fall<br />
            And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind<br />
            You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye<br />
            So this is me swallowing my pride<br />
            Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night<br />
            And I go back to December all the time<br />
            It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<br />
            Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br />
            I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind<br />
            I go back to December all the time<br />
            I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right<br />
            And how you held me in your arms that September night<br />
            The first time you ever saw me cry<br />
            Maybe this is wishful thinking<br />
            Probably mindless dreaming<br />
            But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right<br />
            I'd go back in time and change it but I can't<br />
            So if the chain is on your door, I understand<br />
            But this is me swallowing my pride<br />
            Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night<br />
            And I go back to December<br />
            It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<br />
            Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br />
            I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right<br />
            I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind<br />
            I go back to December all the time all the time<br /></p></center><br />

            For all those times you stood by me <br />
            For all the truth that you made me see <br />
            For all the joy you brought to my life <br />
            For all the wrong that you made right <br />
            For every dream you made come true <br />
            For all the love I found in you <br />
            I'll be forever thankful baby <br />
            You're the one who held me up <br />
            Never let me fall <br />
            You're the one who saw me through through it all <br />
                                                                                                                                                                                                 [CHORUS:]
            You were my strength when I was weak <br />
            You were my voice when I couldn't speak <br />   
            You were my eyes when I couldn't see <br />
            You saw the best there was in me <br />
            Lifted me up when I couldn't reach <br />
            You gave me faith coz you believed <br />
            I'm everything I am <br />
            Because you loved me <br />

            You gave me wings and made me fly <br />
            You touched my hand I could touch the sky <br />
            I lost my faith, you gave it back to me <br />
            You said no star was out of reach <br />
            You stood by me and I stood tall <br />
            I had your love I had it all <br />
            I'm grateful for each day you gave me <br />
            Maybe I don't know that much <br />
            But I know this much is true <br />
            I was blessed because I was loved by you <br />

            [REPEAT CHORUS] <br />

            You were always there for me <br />
            The tender wind that carried me <br />
            A light in the dark shining your love into my life <br />
            You've been my inspiration <br />
            Through the lies you were the truth <br />
            My world is a better place because of you <br />

            You were my strength when I was weak <br />
            You were my voice when I couldn't speak <br />
            You were my eyes when I couldn't see <br />
            You saw the best there was in me <br />
            Lifted me up when I couldn't reach <br />

            Ain't it funny rumors fly<br />
            And I know you heard about me<br />
            So hey, let's be friends<br />
            I'm dying to see how this one ends<br />
            Grab your passport and my hand<br />
            I could make the bad guys good for a weekend<br />

            [Pre-Chorus]<br />

            Or it's gonna go down in flames<br />

            If the high was worth the pain<br />
            Got a long list of ex-lovers<br />
            They'll tell you I'm insane<br />
            Cause you know I love the players<br />
            And you love the game<br />

            [Verse 2]<br />
            Cherry lips<br />
            Crystal skies<br />

            Be that girl for a month<br />
            But the worst is yet to come<br />
            Oh no<br />
            Screaming, crying, perfect storms<br />
            I could make all the tables turn<br />
            Rose garden filled with thorns<br />
            Keep you second guessing like oh my god<br />
            Who is she? I get drunk on jealousy<br />
            But you'll come back each time you leave<br />
            Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream<br />

            [Pre-Chorus]<br />
            So it's gonna be forever<br />
            Or it's gonna go down in flames<br />
            You can tell me when it's over<br />
            If the high was worth the pain<br />
            Got a long list of ex-lovers<br />
            They'll tell you I'm insane<br />
            Cause you know I love the players<br />
            And you love the game<br />

            [Chorus]<br />
            Cause we're young and we're reckless<br />
            We'll take this way too far and leave you breathless<br />
            Or with a nasty scar<br />
            Got a long list of ex-lovers<br />
            They'll tell you I'm insane<br />
            But I got a blank space baby<br />
            And I'll write your name<br />

            [Bridge]<br />
            Boys only want love if it's torture<br />
            Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn you<br />
            Boys only want love if it's torture<br />
            Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn you<br />

            If you want it, take it<br />
            I should have said it before<br />
            Tried to hide it, fake it<br />
            I can't pretend anymore<br />

            I only want to die alive<br />
            Never by the hands of a broken heart<br />
            I don't wanna hear you lie tonight<br />
            Now that I've become who I really are<br />

            This is the part when I say I don't want it<br />
            I'm stronger than I've been before<br />
            This is the part when I break free<br />

            Like a deadly fear I am, babe<br />
            On the highway to hell<br />

            (Our love baby, oooh)<br />
            The thought on your body<br />
            I came alive<br />
            It was lethal<br />
            It was fatal<br />
            In my dreams it felt so right<br />
            But I woke up and pretend<br />

            Swaying room as the music starts<br />
            Strangers making the most of the dark<br />
            Two by two their bodies become one<br />
            I see you through the smokey air<br />
            Can't you feel the weight of my stare<br />
            You're so close but still a world away<br />
            What I'm dying to say, is that<br />
            I'm crazy for you<br />
            Touch me once and you'll know it's true<br />
            I never wanted anyone like this<br />
            It's all brand new<br />
            You'll feel it in my kiss<br />
            I'm crazy for you<br />
            Crazy for you<br />
            Trying hard to control my heart<br />
            I walk over to where you are<br />
            Eye to eye we need no words at all<br />
            Slowly now we begin to move<br />
            Every breath I'm deeper into you<br />
            Soon we two are standing still in time<br />
            If you read my mind, you'll see<br />
            I'm crazy for you<br />
            Touch me once and you'll know it's true<br />

            I feel so small<br /> 
            I guess I need you baby<br />  
            And every time I see<br /> 
            You in my dreams<br /> 
            I see your face<br /> 
            You're haunting me<br /> 
            I guess I need you baby<br /></p></center><br />

            Like a small boat<br />
            On the ocean<br />
            Sending big waves<br />
            Into motion<br />
            Like how a single word<br />
            Can make a heart open<br />
            I might only have one match<br />
            But I can make an explosion<br />
            And all those things I didn't say<br />
            Wrecking balls inside my brain<br />
            I will scream them loud tonight<br />
            Can you hear my voice this time?<br />
            This is my fight song<br />
            Take back my life song<br />
            Prove I'm alright song<br />
            My power's turned on<br />
            Starting right now I'll be strong<br />
            I'll play my fight song<br />
            And I don't really care if nobody else believes<br />
            'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me <br />
            Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep <br />
            Everybody's worried about me <br />
            In too deep <br />
            Say I'm in too deep (in too deep) <br />
            And it's been two years I miss my home <br />
            But there's a fire burning in my bones <br />
            Still believe <br />
            Yeah, I still believe <br />
            And all those things I didn't say <br />
            Wrecking balls inside my brain <br />

            If I would have to live my life again<br />
            I'd stay in love with you the way I've been<br />
            Your love is something no one ever can replace<br />
            I can't imagine life with someone else<br />

            I promise I will share my life with you<br />
            Forever may not be enough it's true<br />
            My heart is filled with so much love<br />
            I feel for you<br />
            No words can say how much I love you so<br />

            Chorus:<br />
            And if, forever's not enough<br />
            For me to love you,<br />
            I'd spend another lifetime baby<br />
            If you'd asked me to<br />
            There's nothing I won't do<br />
            Forever's not enough for me to love you so<br />
            
            They say tomorrow seem so far away<br />
            And now we see that everything can change<br />
            My love for you get stronger as tomorrow comes<br />
            I know this love will stand the test of time<br />
            (Repeat Chorus)<br />

            Bridge:<br />
            For you there's nothing I can do<br />
            And never will I ever go<br />
            Forever's not enough to love you so<br />

            But if forever ends one day<br />
            I promise you I'll stay<br />
            To show you that my love will never end<br />

            (Repeat Chorus except last line)<br />

            Forever's not enough to love you so<br />

            <p> <h3>LYRICS</h3>

            Umiiyak ka na naman<br />
            Langya talaga wala ka bang ibang alam<br />
           Namumugtong mga mata<br />
            Kailan pa ba kaya ikaw magsasawa<br /> 
            Sa problema na iyong pinapasan<br />
            Hatid sayo ng boyfriend mong hindi mo maintindihan<br />

            May kwento kang pandrama na naman<br />
            Parang pang TV na walang katapusan<br />
            Hanggang kailan ka bang ganyan<br />
            Hindi mo ba alam na walang pupuntahan<br />
            Ang pagtiyaga mo dyan sa boyfriend mong tanga<br />
            Na wala nang ginagawa kundi ang paluhain ka<br />

            [Chorus:]<br />
            Sa libu-libong pagkakataon na tayoy nagkasama<br />
            Iilang ulit palang kitang makitang masaya<br />
            Naiinis akong isipin na ginaganyan ka nya<br />
            Siguro ay hindi niya lang alam ang iyong<br />
            Tunay na halaga<br />
            Hindi na dapat pag-usapan pa<br />
            Napapagod na rin ako sa aking kakasalita<br />
            Hindi ka rin naman nakikinig<br />
            Kahit sobrang pagod na ang aking bibig<br /> 
            Sa mga payo kong di mo pinapansin<br />
            Akala mo'y nakikinig di rin naman tatanggapin<br />
            Ayoko nang isipin pa<br />
            Di ko alam ba't di mo makayanan na iwanan sya<br />
            Ang dami-dami naman diyang iba<br />
            Wag kang mangangambang baka wala ka nang ibang Makita<br />
            Na lalake na magmahal sayo<br />
            At hinding hindi nya sasayangin ang pag-ibig mo<br />

            [Repeat Chorus] <br />
            Minsan hindi ko maintindihan<br />
            Parang ang buhay natin ay napagti-tripan<br />
            Medyo Malabo yata ang mundo<br />
            Binabasura ng iba ang siyaNG pinapangarap ko<br />

            [Verse 1]<br />
            Hello, it's me<br />
            I was wondering if after all these years<br />
            You'd like to meet, to go over<br />
            Everything<br />
            They say that time's supposed to heal ya<br />
            But I ain't done much healing<br />

            Hello, can you hear me?<br />
            I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br />
            When we were younger and free<br />
            I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br />

            [Pre-Chorus 1]<br />
            There's such a difference between us<br />
            And a million miles<br />

            [Chorus]<br />
            Hello from the other side<br />
            I must've called a thousand times to tell you<br />
            I'm sorry, for everything that I've done<br />
            But when I call you never seem to be home<br />

            Hello from the outside<br />
            At least I can say that I've tried to tell you<br />
            I'm sorry, for breaking your heart<br />
            But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br />

            [Verse 2]<br />
            Hello, how are you?<br />
            It's so typical of me to talk about myself<br />
            I'm sorry, I hope that you're well<br />
            Did you ever make it out of that town<br />
            Where nothing ever happened?<br />

            [Pre-Chorus 2]<br />
            It's no secret<br />
            That the both of us are running out of time<br />

            [Chorus]<br />
            Hello from the other side<br />
            I must've called a thousand times to tell you<br />
            I'm sorry, for everything that I've done<br />
            But when I call you never seem to be home<br />

            Hello from the outside<br />
            At least I can say that I've tried to tell you<br />
            I'm sorry, for breaking your heart<br />
            But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br />

            [Bridge]<br />
            Ooooohh, anymore<br />
            Ooooohh, anymore<br />
            Ooooohh, anymore<br />
            Anymore<br />

            [Chorus]<br />
            Hello from the other side<br />

            Everything I knew was lovin' you<br />
            How could you try pretending<br />
            Your love was never ending
            Now you can't even say that you will stay<br />

            [Chorus]<br />
            How, how could you say you love me<br />
            When you would go and leave me<br />
            How could you make me hurt so bad<br />
            When I have loved you more than anyone can do<br />
            Can't believe the pain<br />
            That I'm feeling now because of loving<br /> 

            [Refrain]<br />

            [Chorus]<br />

            [Bridge]<br />
            I can't seem to understand<br />
            How can love me so unkind<br />
            Still you broke my heart<br /> 
            Despite what I've done<br />
            Still my love was not enough<br />
            Though I given you my all<br /> 
            I can't take it anymore<br />

            [Chorus]<br /></p></center><br />
